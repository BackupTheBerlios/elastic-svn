		       'gtk' module for elastiC
		       ========================

INTRODUCTION
------------

elastiC is a portable high-level object-oriented interpreted language
with a C like syntax.
gtk is Graphical User Interface (GUI) library written in C.
gdk is the windowing graphic library that constitutes the base layer
on which gtk is built.
'gtk' module is a wrapper to the gtk and gdk libraries for the elastiC
language.

USAGE
-----

gtk elastiC module makes use of automake & autoconf.
To compile it, simply issue the commands:

  % configure
  % make
  % make install

Please note that compilation could take somewhat long times,
especially on not-so-fast machines.

ELASTIC WEB SITE
----------------

elastiC and gtk-elastiC official web site is:

    http://www.elasticworld.org

You'll find here the most recent release, documentation, support
and other valuable information.

INSTALLATION
------------

For a more complete explanation of the compilation process, see
the file "INSTALL".
This module requires elastiC 0.0.10 and has been developed and tested
only with gtk 1.2.3. It _won't_ work with earlier releases of elastiC
and/or with gtk 1.1.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

There is yet no documentation available on gtk module. This is not too bad
however, since this module mimics very closely the original gdk/gtk API.
It is intended, in fact, as a low-level base for the development of an object
oriented gtk-based GUI.
In the mean time, have a look at the examples 'testgtk.ec',
'testgdk.ec' and 'fileview.ec'.

CAVEATS
-------

If you need to use the gdk module alone, you don't need to import the gtk
module. But in every elastiC gtk program you *need* to import gdk *before*
than gtk (at least on linux). This is because the gtk modules stacks onto
gdk and it appears that the dynamic linker does not behave as specified
in the documentation (for the brave men: dlopen with flags RTLD_LAZY
wants to resolve all symbols on loading and not on execution, as it should.
If you know something on this issue that I don't, your help will be highly
appreciated !).

So, for a gdk program:

  import gdk;

and for a gtk (with or without gdk) program:

  import gdk;
  import gtk;
