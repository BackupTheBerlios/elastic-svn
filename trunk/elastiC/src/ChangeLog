2002-06-06  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* modules/posix_m.c: added POSIX functions `getcwd', `mkdir',
	`rmdir', `chdir', `link', `unlink', `rename', `chmod', `chown',
	`dup', `dup2', `pipe', `fork', `execv', `execve', `execvp',
	`wait', `waitpid', `_exit', `kill', `sleep', `pause', `alarm',
	`setuid', `setgid'.

	* modules/posix_m.c: added a `posix.has' hash table, indexed by
	symbols like `#access', `#fork', ... indicating if the named
	functionality is implemented or not.

	* private.h cnf.h.in builtin.c modules/posix_m.c
	modules/Makefile.am: made possible to chose between statically
	linked-in and dynamic for the `posix' modules.

	* compat.h builtin.c elastic.c private.h modules/posix_m.c:
	started implementing a POSIX 1003.1 module.

	* lib.c (EcLibIOErrorClass_New): fixed, it checked for two
	parameters and it received three.

	* memory.h memory.c (ec_allocpool): fixed C++ compatibility
	problem: we had a typedef (ec_mempool) with the same name of a
	struct. Now the struct is named ec_mempool_struct.

2002-06-04  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* elastic.c builtin.c lib.c: added a new instance variable to
	IOError class, containing the posix error (as a symbol, like
	#ENOENT). This is *NOT* a substitute for a hierarchy of exceptions
	derived from IOError! It is only a way to keep track of the
	underlying posix error, when available. We still need to write
	IOError-derived exceptions.

	* oop.c: added functions to get/set instance and class variables
	using symbols instead of strings: EcGetInstanceVariableSym(),
	EcSetInstanceVariableSym(), EcGetClassVariableSym(),
	EcSetClassVariableSym().

2002-06-01  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* Version 0.0.37

	* arithmetic/arithmetic.c (_mod): fixed modulus operation.

	* lib.[ch]: Added `basic.printnl' (EcLibPrintNL).

	* Cleanup of auto* stuff.

2002-05-31  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* hashfunc.[hc]: added djb and sdbm hash functions.

2002-05-27  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* lib.[ch]: Added basic.apply (EcLibApply) and and basic.arity
	(EcLibArity). The former takes two arguments: a callable object
	and a sequence of arguments and returns the result of the
	application of the callable to the arguments.
	For example:

	        function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
		local v = basic.apply( add, #[1, 3] );

	will set v to 4.
	The latter will receive a callable object as a number and will
	return an array of two elements: the first is the number of
	minimum required arguments by the callable, the second if a
	boolean indicating if the callable takes a variable number of
	arguments. The API presently doesn't allow to know the number of
	parameters of primitive functions, so basic.arity works only for
	bytecode objects at the moment.

2002-05-24  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* compile.c (EcCompilerContextCreate): now ctxt members are
	properly initialized. This fixes a(nother) bug discovered by
	George McBay.

	* gc.c (heap_grow): now zeros newly-allocated chunks. This fixes a
	bug discovered by George McBay: the object table release routine
	crashed because it descended erroneously-non-NULL pointers (the
	bug showed up only on windows, and now even on unix with
	EC_DIRTY_MALLOC).

	* memory.c (memfill, memfill_dword, ec_malloc): Added
	uninitialized malloc()ed memory detection support (enabled by
	EC_DIRTY_MALLOC).

	* conf.h: Added uninitialized malloc()ed memory detection macros
	(EC_DIRTY_MALLOC, EC_DIRTY_PATTERN).

2002-05-21  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* object.c packageio.c types/stack.c: made 64-bit clean.

	* object.h: made 64-bit clean.

	* strtod.c: new version. Taken from today's freebsd commit
	(derived from netbsd). This version is finally alpha compatible.

2002-05-??  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* dl/dl-dl.c: added. This is a dynamic loading backend which uses
	directly dlopen()/dlsym() without resorting to libltdl.
	It is possible to choose the backend with the `configure' option
	"--with-dlbackend".

2002-01-08  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* types/object.c (EcMakeObject): properly initializes to
	@undefined newly allocated instance variables (closes a bug
	uncovered by disabling EC_PARANOID_CODE).

	* stack.c (EcMakeStack): properly initializes to @undefined newly
	allocated stack space (closes a bug uncovered by disabling
	EC_PARANOID_CODE).

	* packageio.c (read_object): properly initializes fields in newly
	allocated bytecode object (closes a bug uncovered by disabling
	EC_PARANOID_CODE).

	* memory.c dstring.c: conditionalized paranoid memory
	initializations with EC_PARANOID_CODE.

2001-11-28  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* basic.h: changes to enhance portability on 64 bit platforms like
	Alpha.

	* elastic.c (EcCompileError): fixed.

	* elastic.h compile.c lib.[hc]: first implementation of
	basic.compile(), which allows to compile a string at run-time and
	obtain a callable bytecode object. The resulting object can be
	invoked as a normal function. This provides the so-called `eval'
	functionality.

2001-11-25  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* elastic_p.y ast.[hc] compile.c: "import ..." and "from
	... import ..." are now regular statements. Now it's possible to
	import a package anywhere. (Feature needed to implement
	"eval"). The compiler is now totally re-entrant.

2001-11-24  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* modules-dynamic/re/re_m.c: fixed some things. Added re.info(),
	re.match_re(), re.match_subject()

	* modules/string_m.c: added string.range()

2001-11-22  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* debug.h stackrecycle.h interp.c sprintf.c: fixed #if conditions
	that caused erratic behaviour (defined() was not used...).

2001-11-21  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* strtod.c: now correctly sets architecture macros also with -ansi
	option of gcc

	* sprintf.c: changed implementation of positional argument
	handling. Now it doesn't require taking the address of va_arg()
	(which wasn't portable and it didn't work in newer versions of gcc
	as 2.96 and 3.x). The current implementations should also be ANSI
	C safe.

2001-11-18  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* Makefile.am (libelastic_la_LDFLAGS): switched back to -release
	versioning scheme instead of -version-info, waiting to find a
	correct numbering scheme.

2001-11-14  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* types/string.c: added '%' syntax to create strings with
	printf-like specifiers:

	   "%d %s %-10s %.2f" % #[6, 1.2, "hey", 12.1]

	* compile.c (compileFunction, ...) interp.c elastic_p.y object.h
	elastic.h: added default values for function and method
	parameters. Now it is possible to specify something like:

		private m = 8;

		private function f1(a, b, c = a * b + m)
		{
			return a + b + c;
		}

	(the default values are evaluated at function call time inside the
	function scope).

2001-11-04  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* interp.c (EcExecute): Improved error messages for uncaught
	exceptions (now the package and the filename are printed, in
	addition to the line number).

2001-11-03  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* packageio.c ec.c ecrt.c: using EC_SOURCESUFFIX and EC_COMPILEDSUFFIX.

	* lib.[hc]: added basic.printf

	* sprintf.c: better error messages.

	* elastic.h sprintf.c: added named conversion specifiers (ala
	Python): as in %(name)s, %12(name)s, %(name)12s, %4.1(name)f,
	%(name)4.1f, ...

2001-10-29  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* ecdump.c (dump_bytecode): removed a reference to elastiC private
	data (which is stripped from the shared library).

	* elastic_p.y compile.c: multiple simultaneous assignment and
	sequence assignment are now expressions.

	* elastic_p.y compile.c: implemented sequence assignment to
	multiple lvalues:
	   [lvalue1, ..., lvalueN] = expression
	where `expression' produces a sequence of length >= N

	* elastic_p.y compile.c: changed syntax of multiple simultaneous
	assignment: now uses brackets ([...] = [...]) instead of
	parenthesis to avoid a reduce/reduce conflict in the grammar.

2001-10-28  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* libltdl: updated to version 1.2

2001-10-27  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* compile.c: added dumpScope()

2001-10-25  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* added debug data to bytecode objects. Removed SetLineOP
	bytecode: now line information is stored in debug info.

	* packageio.c (write_object): fixed bug: only hash keys were saved
	before.

2001-10-24  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* hashfunc.[hc]: improved hashing for floating point values (it
	should give the same results on architectures with the same FP
	representation, even if with different endianness).

	* sprintf.c: made somewhat more ANSI friendly. Still not completed
	because of &va_arg() in __find_arguments().

	* stackrecycle.h interp.c: made ANSI-friendly.

	* types/char.c (EcMakeChar): fixed (for a strange coincidence it
	worked on i86, but not on Sparc, ...).

2001-10-23  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* sprintf.c: rewritten using vfprintf.c from FreeBSD 4.4 libc as
	the code base. Now it doesn't depend anymore on ecvt() (this
	should make elastiC more portable, for example on BSD :). Some
	other conversion specifiers are implemented: %b for booleans
	(EcBool) and %I for elastiC integers (EcInt).

	* strtod.c: added (this adds _ec_strtod() and _ec_dtoa()
	functions).

	* elastic.h symbol.c: added EcSymbolExists() API function.

	* compat/*.c: new versions of compatibility functions.

	* elastic_p.y ast.[hc] compile.c: multiple simultaneous assignment.

2001-10-19  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* upgraded to PCRE 3.5 (which includes preliminary UTF-8 support)

	* moved globals LINE, COLUMN, CHARNUM to interpreter structure
	(and renamed to `line', `column', `charnum')

	* interp.c arithmetic/arithmetic.c: still some speed improvements

2001-10-18  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* bitstring.h stackrecycle.h: applied fixes suggested by Alexander
	Bokovoy (missing comments on #endif's).

	* arithmetic/arithmetic.c: applied fixes suggested by Alexander
	Bokovoy (improper preprocessor string concatenation operator
	usage).

2001-10-16  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* Stack objects are now recycled through a pool. This avoids
	massive allocations and greatly speeds up function calls. It is
	delicate though because it requires to maintain a reference count
	on stack objects.

2001-10-15  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* Stack objects now contain a small inlined space (configured in
	conf.h) to avoid an allocation for small stack spaces. Good
	speed-up.

	* unix/os.c (ec_get_times): fixed. This fixes elastiC function
	basic.times().

2001-10-14  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* switched back to old union style for subtypes to avoid gnu-isms
	in accessor macros. Changes to allow smooth compilation on
	strictly ANSI compilers.

2001-10-08  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* compile.c (compileRoot): added proper (re)initialization of the
	compilation environment. This fixes a bug that appeared only when
	calling multiple times EcCompile() (noticed by James Skarzinskas).

	* compile.c: Fixed check for function/method return
	(hasReturned).

	* packageio.c (write_object, read_object, patch_bytecode): Now
	also hash objects are saved/loaded.

	* packageio.c (write_object, read_object): Now also stack objects
	are saved/loaded. Class code is executed when a class is loaded.

2001-10-05  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* ec.c (main) ecc.c (main) ecdump.c (main) ecrt.c (main): The
	return value of getopt is now saved in an 'int' (instead of a
	'char') to avoid bogus comparison on platforms where 'char's are
	unsigned by default.

2001-10-04  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* Added proper cast in ctype.h macros (is...()).

	* cnf.h.in memory.[hc] ast.c: Now the pool allocator takes into
	account alignment issues. This should fix alignment problems on
	platforms like Sparc, MIPS, m68k, ...

	* compat.[hc] compat/getsetenv.c: added getenv, setenv, unsetenv
	compatibility functions.

2001-10-03  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* Makefile.am: Fixed bug in static-only versions of elastiC. The
	-rdynamic flag has been added, so that symbols in the elastiC
	executables can be referenced from shared objects (like C
	packages).

	* Makefile.am: Adapted to automake-1.5

	* A new elastiC library without the compiler is built
	(elasticrt). Also a new run-time only executable (capable of
	executing only pre-compiled packages) has been added: ecrt.
	This latter one, compiled without debugging, optimized and
	stripped is only 166 Kb in size (on x86).

2001-09-30  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* elastic.h types/hash.c: Added API functions to manipulate
	elastiC hash tables: see EcHash...() functions.

	* Changed API names for C hash-tables and string-tables from
	EcHash... to ec_hash_... and from EcStrTable... to
	ec_strtable_...

2001-09-29  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* packageio.c (load_shared_package): Fixed support for nested
	C packages.

	* Makefile.am: switched to libtool versioning, with -version-info
	option.

2001-09-27  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* added user data to primitive functions. User data is passed in
	when creating/registering a new primitive function, and then on
	each invocation the user data is passed to the C function.
	The user data can be an EcAny value or an elastiC object: in the
	latter case the object will be marked and/or garbage collected as
	needed (you specify if it is an object through a parameter).
	This feature turns out to be useful in FFI mechanisms.

	* unix/os.c: CLOCKS_PER_SEC wasn't a good substitute for
	CLK_TCK. Fixed (but would need a more elegant/portable solution).

	* types/array.c (array_copy): fixed.

2001-09-26  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* elastic.h oop.c: added EcGetClassVariable() and
	EcSetClassVariable().

2001-09-23  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* unix/os.c: switched from CLK_TCK to more modern CLOCKS_PER_SEC

2001-03-22  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* elastic_s.l elastic_p.y: Added assign-ops (**=, *=, /=, +=,
	...).
	Added also a suitable test source for regression testing.

2000-11-22  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* hashtable.[ch] primes.h: now primes for hash expansion are
	distributed more intelligently. Tables up to 10^9 ca. entries are
	now supported.

2000-11-08  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* ec.c ecc.c ecdump.c: changed version option to -V, and added
	verbose option on -v.

2000-11-07  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* interp.c: generates an UnimplementedException when trying to
	execute a non-bytecode object.

	* elastic.h builtin.c lib.c ...: added UnimplementedException, to
	be able to use an exception even when a proper class for that
	exception has not been yet implemented :-)

2000-02-20  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* elastic-config: Added options for 'makemodule' script.

	* Added 'makemodule' and support for it in makefiles and automake
	macros.

2000-02-19  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* compat.c: added a missing #if (preventing compilation on RedHat/Alpha
	for example)

2000-02-18  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* Improved support for cross compilation in different subdirectories.

2000-02-13  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* Finished initial support for Win32:
	All basic functionality is there, even dynamic C module loading
	(with DLLs).
	Compilation is done with Mingw32 compiler toolchain by Mumit Khan
	<khan@xraylith.wisc.edu>
	(http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/)
	but cross-compiling from linux (thanks to Allin Cottrell for the
	hints on setting up the environment; see enclosed mingw.sh script
	for more info).
	Native compilation from Cygwin + Mingw32 from Win32 should be
	possible, but presently untested.
	There is even embrional, unfinished support for Microsoft Visual
	C++ 6.0 compilers.

2000-01-21  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* Started basic Win32 support.

	* Added C++ compiler compatibility support (extern "C" { ... }).

	* Added EC_API macro prefix on public API symbols (variables and
	functions).

2000-01-19  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* gc.c private.h: Modified heap handling. GC was very misbehaved:
	in some situations we had GC happening over and over, freeing only 
	one or two objects at a time. Now it seems to work much better.
	(Only to give some numbers: gtk module generator had a speed
	increase of 943% ! Over nine times faster !).

	* object.h ...: added inlined symbols. Inlined chars are more
	problematic, since the tc_char type is defined in a module.

	* Introduced dynamic loading API and an implementation based on
	libltdl (should work on most Unixes and on Windows).

	* Makefile.am ...: switched to libtool convenience libraries for
	arithmetic, types and modules directories (requires automake 1.4
	or later). Now we can avoid installing unused libraries.

2000-01-16  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* interp.c (EcExecute): Some optimizations: avoiding temporaries
	in bytecode like PushHereOP, common case duplication for
	PushLiteralOP, ...

	* object.h (EC_MAKE_INT) ...: switched to inlined integer objects
	(switchable with EC_INLINED_INUM (flag which will go away if the
	system proves stable enough)). Performance gain is great: >30% for 
	integer loops. Doing integer math we also avoid object creation:
	great memory saving too ! Stay tuned for inlined chars, symbols,
	...

2000-01-15  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* Integrated libltdl (from libtool-1.3.4) to dynamically open
	modules. Should greatly improve portability. However I want to
	introduce a specific elastiC API, avoiding direct contact with
	libltdl.

2000-01-10  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* interp.c (backtrace): backtrace now prints line number if
	available.

2000-01-09  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* types/array.c (array_copy): fixed a typo causing copy not being
	performed.

	* types/hash.c (hash_copy): fixed a typo causing copy not being
	performed.

	* interp.c (backtrace): print backtrace on uncaught exception.

2000-01-06  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* lib.c (EcLibTargetErrorClass_New): fixed parameter count: caused 
	bogus error on TargetError exception.

	* compile.c (compileStmtList, compileFunction, compileMethod):
	fixed for empty methods and functions.

	* types/object.c (object_true): fixed to make logic value testing
	work also for instances of classes without a '_true' method.

2000-01-05  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* lib.c (EcLibCopy, EcLibShallowCopy, EcLibDeepCopy): fixed
	a typo in parameter parsing (basic.*copy() functions didn't work).

2000-01-04  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* sprintf.c (cvt): changed modification in cvt(): caused serious
	bug in floating point printing.

2000-01-02  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* types/stack.c (EcMakeStackForCompiled): Now appropriately set
	EC_STACKLEXICAL for the created frame (the bug showed up on
	callbacks called by EcCallArgs() & friends, where lexical scoping
	didn't work (C called bytecode)).

2000-01-01  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* modules/string_m.c (EcLibString_Split): fixed string.split()
	(now correctly handles zero-length substrings and max splits
	semantics).

	* elastic_p.y: Fixed syntax for varargs (now allows for no
	mandatory parameters, in other words only optional parameters).

	* modules/string_m.c (EcLibString_Find): string.find() returns
	false when no match is found.

	* elastic.c (EcInit): Now we preallocate exception for memory
	errors, to prevent recursion on low memory conditions.

	* lib.h lib.c builtin.c elastic.h: Added MathError and IOError
	exception classes.

1999-12-27  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* types/stack.c (EcParseStackV): now on error skip parameter count 
	check (avoiding wrong error signalling).

	* oop.h elastic.h oop.c ...: changed API of class definition: now
	EcAddClassDef() gets a structure (this way code looks less messy).

1999-12-25  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* gc.c (EcAllocObject): Since GC happens only at top-level (to
	avoid C stack scanning), EcAllocObject() now tries to expand the
	heap if no space is available.

1999-12-11  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* packageio.c: Moved objectmap used for patching bytecodes to
	global context (in private datastructure), since it have to
	remember for the whole package loading context, which is longer
	than a single (even if toplevel) package loading.

	* elastic.h interp.c: Added EcSequenceSetElement()

	* modules/array_m.c: Added 'array' module, with length(), push(),
	pop(), shift(), unshift(), sub(), find()

	* types/string.c (string_setitem): Now string exapands on lvalue
	indexing.

	* elastic.c (EcInit) private.h: Updated for element removal.

	* types/string.c types/stack.c types/compiled.c types/object.c
	types/hash.c types/array.c: Updated for element removal.

	* elastic.h interp.c: Added EcSequenceDelElement(),
	EcSequenceDelItem(), EcArrayDel()

	* user.h (EcSequenceCallbacks): Added delitem_fcn

	* interp.c (EcSequenceNormalizeIndex): now normalize only for
	sequences with length_fcn (for example hashes _can_ have negative
	indexes as keys)

1999-12-10  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* types/array.c types/char.c types/string.c: added *_true()
	callbacks.

	* interp.c (EcExecute): Corrected behavior for LNotOP (didn't
	check for error after ec_unaryop_true).

1999-12-05  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* compile.c elastic_p.y elastic_s.l elastic.c: split compilation
	in two phases (well, the second one is not really a phase, since
	it does not scan the AST, but it could easily do). So I added
	labels and goto.

	* hashtable.c: corrected an undetected bug: on expansion we
	_copied_ keys and values, when we had better simply copied their
	pointers.

	* list.c list.h: added.

1999-12-02  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* builtin.c (EcObjectClass_Methods) lib.*: Added
	'doesUnderstand' method to basic.Object.

	* elastic_p.y: Added varargs for keyword methods.

	* types/stack.c: Added some more checks for proper number of
	parameters. I should find a cleaner solution though.

	* builtin.c (EcObjectClass_ClassMethods) lib.*: Added class method 
	'fullname' to basic.Object returning qualified class name and made
	'name' method returning unqualified name.

	* elastic.h lib.*: added basic.send(), which calls a method for an 
	object (better: sends a message to an object), given the receiver
	object, the method symbol and the parameters to pass. Added also
	basic.sendwith(), which performs the same task as basic.send but
	receiving parameters for the method as an array.

	* interp.c (EcExecute): Now ReturnOP properly re-establish self
	and at_class (this bug caused erratic method and instance
	references upon return from a method call).

	* elastic.c (EcCallArgs): Now EcCallArgs set caller, self and
	at_class slots in stack in every case (this bug caused 'self' to
	be @nil in init method).

1999-11-28  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* packageio.c (write_object) (read_object): Fixed
	CallSuperMethodOP saving/loading (previously we saved the id for
	the method symbol, which is obviously wron; now we do the same as
	for CallOP).

	* bytecode.c: Fixed stack growth values for CallMethodOP and
	CallSuperMethodOP (it's 1, not 0 as for CallOP, since we don't pop
	anything from the stack, aside from parameters)

1999-11-27  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* modules/string_m.c (EcLibString_ToUpper) (EcLibString_ToLower): 
	corrected a bug (previously a string undersized by 1 char was
	allocated, and the corresponding object wasn't created using its
	length).

	* compile.c (getQualifiedSymbol): Now we correctly use
	EC_PACKAGEEXPORT(pkgObj)[i].pos (the saved position) for exported
	symbols in other packages, instead of sequential position in
	export list, since in the package frame there are also
	non-exported values and so position in package frame != position
	in export list. This bug showed up when inserting private
	variables in packages *loaded* by other packages. When the loading 
	one referenced a public variable in the incriminated package, an
	offset was observed, making the compiler choose the wrong value
	(see regression test prog.ec+used.ec). (MAJOR BUG FIX)

	* elastic.h: Changed API interface for argc, argv passing. The
	mode of operation, setted sys.args at initialization time, thus
	causing a potential shift for object loading when loading compiled 
	packages. This buggy behavior was observable only when passing
	parameters to a compiled package that loaded other packages. Now
	parameters have to be passed just before EcMainExecute(), *after*
	all loading! (MAJOR BUG FIX)

1999-11-26  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* tsize.h basic.h: Added 'configure' dependant image sizes.

1999-11-25  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* types/file.c (file_free): now doesn't close std* files on free

	* packageio.c: Now correctly saves PRIVATE(ncoreglobals) instead
	of PRIVATE(nglobals) in packages, to deal with dynamically loaded
	C modules.

	* elastic.c (EcCleanup): Moved code for cleanup of dynamically
	loaded packages after object table release (otherwise an user
	defined object with release code in the module would segfault on
	release code execution). Also corrected its behavior, now performs 
	a final GC, after a removal of toplevel references, then frees
	objects.

	* elastic-config.in: Added --ccshared, --ldshared,
	--linkforshared, --so

	* packageio.c: now uses default search path for modules.

1999-11-24  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* modules/re/re_m.c ...: Added regular expression 're' module
	(based on pcre-2.08)

1999-11-22  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* dstring.h: Added ec_string_prepare()

	* modules/string_m.c: Added string.ltrim(), string.rtrim(),
	string.trim(), string.split(), string.join(), string.find()

1999-11-21  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* numeric.c (EcLibEq): Added check for @nil

1999-11-20  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* elastic-config.in: Added.

	* ecdump.c (main): Added option 'v'

	* ecc.c (main): Added option '-v'

	* ec.c (main): Added option '-v'

	* elastic.h elastic.c cnf.h.in: Add library versioning API

1999-11-16  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* lib.c (EcLibString_ToUpper/Lower): Now handle strings, not only
	characters.

1999-11-10  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* ecdump.c (main): Added option 'h'

	* ecc.c (main): Added option '-h'

	* ec.c (main): Added option support and '-h' option (doesn't
	understant --help, but tolerates it), after a suggestion by David
	N. Welton (davidw@linuxcare.com)

1999-11-07  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* lib.c ...: added basic.copy, basic.shallowcopy,
	basic.deepcopy. Reorganized a little the initialization process.

	* types/file.c: now we don't reintern symbols for every
	invocation.

	* interp.c: now uses the right frame traversing, by using
	EC_STACKCALLED(). Now static variable reference in upper
	environments from closures works ok.

	* types/stack.c (stack_mark): corrected a undetected bug:
	EC_STACKIMM* entries were not marked !

	* object.h (_stack) ...: added EC_STACKCALLED() (called bytecode
	is saved in stack frame structure). This is *needed* to get to the 
	right literal in environment traversing at run-time (in fact the
	implementation used before was wrong, and showed up in static var.
	reference in closures :))

1999-11-05  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* compile.c (compileDecl) ...: added static variable support
	(initialization stuff, ...)

	* object.h object.c ...: added tc_undefined (@undefined)

1999-11-04  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* compile.c (compileFunction): corrected a bug on closure
	creation. Before closure creation always returned the code object
	on the literal frame, but saving lexical context modified the same
	literal over and over. Now we make a copy and return that copy.
	The bug showed up for example, when referring from a closure to a
	parameter of the enclosing function (it was referenced always the
	last used frame (=> last used parameter), giving the illusion of
	predicting the future !

	* user.h user.c ...: added copy construction to user-defined types
	(shallow and deep). Everything must support copy construction, but 
	some types could be peculiar in this regard (see doc/devel/OBJECTCOPY).

1999-08-05  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* compile.c (compileConstant): corrected a bug: now constant
	strings are copied when created (creation/modify loop with
	constant strings now work)

1999-08-04  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* oop.c (EcSendMessageVA): added self and at_class to the stack
	when sending a message (before this it was buggy: method
	implementation didn't received self !)

1999-08-01  Marco Pantaleoni  <panta@elasticworld.org>

	* ec.c ecc.c (main): Modified for sys.argv

	* builtin.c (_ec_register_builtin): Added sys.argv

	* elastic.y: Added anonymous package (no more need for declaring a 
	package).
