H1: SYNOPSIS

B<ec> S<[ B<-h> ]>

B<ec> S<[ B<-V> ]>

B<ec> S<[ B<-v> ]> S<[ B<-l> ]> [ I<program_source> ] [ I<argument> ]...

B<ec> S<[ B<-v> ]> [ I<program_bytecode> ] [ I<argument> ]...

H1: DESCRIPTION

B<ec> is the program responsible for the execution of elastiC code.
If invoked with a source file (with extension .ec), it will provide
to compile it on the fly before starting execution. Otherwise, if
a bytecode object file is given as argument, it will start immediately
its execution.

H1: OPTIONS

* B<-h> show usage information

* B<-v> be verbose

* B<-l> lazy programmer mode: variable declaration is optional

* B<-V> display version information

H1: RETURN VALUE

On a fatal error, the program returns an exit code greater than 0.

H1: EXAMPLES

> ec hello.ec
>
> ec hello.ecc
>
> ec factorial.ec 6
>
> ec factorial.ecc 6

H1: SEE ALSO

L<ecc(1)>: for the compiler alone

L<ecdump(1)>: for the bytecode disassembler

L<elastic(1)>: for the language

H1: BUGS
