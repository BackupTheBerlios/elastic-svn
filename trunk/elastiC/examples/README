This directory contains some examples of programs written in elastiC.
Quite simple ones at this time :-)

Examples:

  Program                   Description
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  balance.ec                Demonstrates use of anonymous functions
                            to implement and object-oriented mechanism.
  balance-lazy.ec           Same as previous one, but without explicit
                            variable declaration. Requires use of the
                            "-l" command line flag ("lazy" option).

  wc.ec                     Simple word count.
  wc-lazy.ec                Simple word count. Lazy version.
  wc-oldstyle.ec            Simple word count using the obsoleted 'file'
                            package.
