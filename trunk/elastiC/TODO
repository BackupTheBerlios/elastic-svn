core
{
	* implement a GenericError / UnknownError exception, RangeError, ...
	* add fundamental types ec_int8, ec_uint8, ec_int16, ec_uint16, ...,
	  ec_char, ec_schar, ec_uchar, ec_short, ec_ushort, ec_int, ec_uint, ...
          ec_bool, ec_off64. Change EcInt, EcWord, EcBool, ... to ec_int,
	  ec_uint16, ec_bool, ...
	* redesign/fix package name handling (qualified package names for nested
	  packages, saving package name in bytecode, qualified symbols, ...).
	  We have to be able to specify absolute and relative package names
	  (for example "import .pkgname" could be relative to current level,
	   while "import pkgname" could be absolute). We should have a
           function to find a package by name (returning a stream), receiving
           current package level or object, and the name of the package to
           load. The function should obey to a plugin architecture: so we
           could pass a function to perform the actual filename space search
           (avoiding so actual filesystem related calls in generic code, and
            making possible bundling of modules in particular streams (i.e.
            string structured streams, using XML/tar/cpio/whatever) or
            similar things).
	* throw an error on wrong argcount to method `new'
	* check order of EC_STACKPOP calls in lib.c
	o fix exception handling in compiler (for basic.compile())
	* add hooks to specify behavior for uncaught exceptions
	  (asked by Anton A.Khorkov)
	o unload functionality for elastiC modules (asked by Yuri)
	o key filtering on dictionaries (hooks for key comparison
	  and hashing, on the elastiC side).
	o general iteration support
	o add generic construction support
	* API I/O functions.
	* convert all libc I/O functions invocations.
	* generic I/O with an elastiC high level file type acting as an
	  abstraction built on lower levels (C streams, OO I/O API, ...)
	o handle const flag (EC_CONSTP()).
	o evaluate a simpler hashing scheme with doubling and simple linear
	  searching (check and benchmark `src/hashtable_new').
	o add caching to hash tables.
	o add Bytecode Description Blocks (& Package Description Blocks) to
	  describe variables, line numbers, ... in code (for debugging
	  support).
	o handle versioning in modules
	* add C pointer registration (with identification, for serialization
	  and package save/reload). Pointer info should include versioning
	  information for runtime linking.
	  o maybe that with pointer information we could avoid hard-coding
	    primtive function name in EC_TYPEERROR_* macros, and EcParseStack*().
	    Investigate.
	* use the G bit in object flags not only for tc_primitive, but for any
	  type having userdata (EC_OBJECTUSER(), ...) so that we can use the
	  registerd C pointers table to save/load objects in packageio.c and
	  in serialization.
	* add an object serialization (passivation/activation) framework
	  (with optional filtering). (See previous point on pointer registration).
	  It should be implemented taking into account registration of new
	  named streaming engines. Two built-in streaming modes are required
	  ("binary", "text"). Support for streaming delegates ?
	* consider making types first class objects too.
	* consider adding method support to (every) type.
	* add classes to primitive types. (?)
	  (perhaps changing EcFindMethod() to handle ordinary objects)
	  o add automatic class generation with marshalling methods to packages
	    defining functions which receive as first argument objects of the
	    introduced type (via an ad-hoc API function to call after
	    EcPackageIntroduce()).
	* consider making basic types subclassable.
          (problem: creation of instances of subclasses: how to create the
           ordinary object at the base of hierarchy? Perhaps we need generic
	   construction and have to modify EcLibObjectClass_New() (and
	   EcMakeObject() or avoid EcMakeObject() and use something else, like
	   generic construction))
	  o how about direct type checks in source code? The new subclassed types
	    will not be recognized in many parts of the system. What will be the
	    the impact of this fact? Solutions? (Using method calss is too expensive).
	* finish hash table expansion (use next prime calculation) (still
	  needed?)
	o change tc_compiled to tc_bytecode
	o change object to instance (tc_object -> tc_instance, ...)
	. evaluate the possibility of using bound functions & methods.
	. add license file. Add --license (-L) option to programs: ec, ecc,
	  ecdump, ecgtk, ...
	* add -l ELASTICPATH to ec, ecc, ecdump, ecrt, ...
	* handle circular reference problem in printing, passivating, ...
	  ("hash table" or "hare and tortoise")
	. add linux kernel module for elastiC executables.
	o add the possibility of stripping debug info.
	* change 2nd argument from 0 to -1 in EcMakeString().
	* benchmark ec_hash_djb_*() vs ec_hash_pjw_*() and eventually use it
	  by default.
	o eliminate all EcParseStack*() calls in bundled libraries.
	* add prefixes to (unprefixed) global symbols.
	* move globals in private context structure.
	* check EC_DEFAULTLIBPATH issue in cnf.h.in
	* why some parts in the object union are not using the generic
	  `usr' struct (like C Primitive and C Method) ?
	* consider adding a configuration API, so that Win32 can use the
	  registry or ini files and env. variables, while Unix can use env.
	  variables and/or configuration files, ...
	! [BUG] a buggy _print method does not generate an exception but
	  is ignored.
	! check printing of arrays (seems like that "[" is printed instead
	  of "#[").
	o change ec_find_upper_prime to ec_prime_next.
	* check & correct method names without ending colon ':'
	* FILE STRUCTURE REORGANIZATION:
	    1. move files like hash.h and file.h in types/
	    2. make a separate subdirectory for library primitives & classes
	       (lib.[hc] & co.)
	    3. separate subdirectory for utilities ?
	    4. separate subdirectory for compiler ?
	. remove old non-inlined code. Change when possible from EC_TYPE to
	  EC_OBJTYPE (for example in gc.c, ...)
	. remove boolean, ints, symbols implementations from object structure.
	  Use only pointer comparison for undefined and booleans.
	o move tc_undefined, tc_error and tc_bool away from the beginning of
	  type codes (so to have tc_inum == 1, tc_symbol == 2).
	. cache hash values in objects [DANGEROUS ?]
	o write more exception classes (and use them). Complete class
	  hierarchies for existing exceptions (like IOError, ...)
	. reintroduce multiple interpreters (for things like Apache
          mod_elastiC, ...)

	DONE: * eliminate SetLineOP moving the line number information to
	        a separate data structure, field of EcCompiled. This could
		be a list (byte code index, line number). Could (should) be
		part of debugging information.
	DONE: * integrate GNU libltdl & use a machine independent shared module
		layer.
	DONE: o evaluate the possibility of incorporating `nargs' into stack
		structure.
	DONE: o make string construction at run-time.
	DONE: * includes: <elastiC/*.h>

	DONE: * add function pointers "getitem", "setitem", "promote" to user
		data-types.
	DONE: * implement generic math operations.
	DONE: o named arguments in ec_*printf() functions (fetching from hashes).
	DONE: o add the full path to errors/exceptions (asked by Yuri).
	DONE: o make the source extension (.ec) configurable (asked by Yuri).
	DONE: * modify hash function for floating point values.
	DONE: o inlined small stack space, recycle stacks, stack space pool
		(great performance improvement).
	DONE: o try to speed up function/method invocation.
	DONE: o for 0.0.25: option for separating the compiler and the
		interpreter run-time.
	DONE: o for 0.0.24: hash tables API.
	DONE: ! [BUG] test nested packages written in C !!!
	DONE: o eliminate SetLineOP (adding debug sections): it causes
		otherwise equal bytecodes to appear different.
	DONE: o add support for (native) integers bigger than 4 bytes (for
		Alpha and other 64bit processors). On these platforms package
		save/reload doesn't work right.
	DONE: * some inlined math operations could be performed without
		extraction (e.g. comparisons, ...). Do it.
	DONE: * check instance trueness code.
	DONE: ! [BUG] check possible bug: indexing nil not detected !
	DONE: ! [BUG] empty methods don't work. Fix it.
	DONE: ! EcMemoryError() cause infinite recursion. Preallocate stack
		& object to avoid this behavior.
	DONE: ! IMPORTANT !!! Disable key & value copy on hash expansion !!!
	DONE: o change generic hashtable API names to ec_* convention.
	DONE: o change EcStrTable* to ec_strtable*, ...
	DONE: o finish adding copy construction to:
		  handler.c, hash.c, object.c, package.c, stack.c, string.c
	DONE: o add CopyOP bytecode (1 parameter: type, 1 operand: object)
	DONE: o correct compileConstant for compiled objects.
	DONE: o add object copy construction methods (class methods).
	DONE: o add basic.copy(...), basic.shallowcopy(...),
		basic.deepcopy(...).
	DONE: * check static variables.
	DONE: o add elastiC version number in code (and also print it in ec,
		ecc).
	DONE: o change package search in packageio.c (use EC_ELASTICLIBVAR +
		an autoconfigured default path) and update accordingly
		elastic-config.

   /* language */
        o add the 'switch' statement
        . evaluate optional (variable) typing and type-information
          flow/deduction
	* add named formal parameters

	* syntax to add methods outside class declarations.
	o syntax: slices a[l..h]
	o syntax: invariants (pre/post-conditions, invariants, assertions, ...)
	o syntax: code documentation
	. syntax: add construct (???):
	      for i in sequence where condition
	o syntax: add 'break' in exception handlers (jumping to the end) ?
	* syntax: add 'finally' block
	o syntax: method catalogs/protocols (?)
	o syntax: support for \nnn (octal) and \xnn (hex) in characters and
		  strings.
	* syntax: evaluate changing syntax for array and hash construction:
		  #[ seems more appropriate to hashes, maybe @[ or @( for
		  arrays.
	DONE: * syntax: multiple simultaneous assignment:
	        (a, b, c) = (b, c, a)
	DONE: * multiple simultaneous assignment from an array.
	DONE: * add expression 'in' (ala Python).
	DONE: * add ++, --, +=, -=, *=, ... etc.
	DONE: add default values for formal parameters (done in 0.0.33)

ideas
{
	o abstract filesystem interface (VFS) -- *ROUGH* idea
	  We could provide a module implementing a new stream type and a
          set of open(), readdir(), mkdir(), ... functions. The whole
          thing should be an abstract interface, so that actual implementations
          could be plugged. The abstract interface would use a URL-like naming
          scheme to dispatch operationg to the proper implementation.
          We could then add: normal fs, in-memory filesystem, tar, cpio, XML, ...
	  (and the stream could be attached to a regular file stream or to a
           string stream, network stream, ...).
          Using this thing we could bundle many bytecode modules in a single
          "virtual filesystem" residing in a string for example.
          (add a primitive filesystem type (similar in spirit to stream split
           implementation)?)
}

/* ========================================================================
 *   PROBLEMS
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------ */

(*) PROBLEM:

When saving a package, we can save objects coming from imported
packages too. In a future run, when loading the previously saved
package, we'll load its imported packages, then load the objects.
This means that objects coming from imported packages will be
duplicated (they were loaded once when loading imported packages, then
a second time when loading objects saved). This happens for example
with super classes coming from imported objects.
The problem is that, apart being a waste of space, for classes a
loaded class doesn't get its class code executed when loaded, so that
static variables don't get set.

Solution: saving/loading also stacks in packageio.c and executing
class code whenever a class is loaded (this was necessary anyway).

Complete solution: full passivation implementation. Packages should
stream completely also imported packages.
