		     'skeleton' module for elastiC
                     =============================

INTRODUCTION
------------

elastiC is a portable high-level object-oriented interpreted language
with a C like syntax.
'skeleton' is a basic module useful as a template for the creation
of elastiC modules written in C. It's very minimal, so it should be
easy to understand its mechanisms. Note that this is not a tutorial on
the elastiC API, but a guide through the issues of Makefiles,
compiling, linking, ...

USAGE
-----

The skeleton module is fully functional, though somewhat silly.
It makes use of automake & autoconf.
To compile it, simply issue the commands:

  % configure
  % make
  % make install

The test program is 'testskeleton.ec'. After compilation, do:

  % ec testskeleton.ec

this will run the program, loading the skeleton module.
