		      byacc with elastiC support
		      ==========================

INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a modified version of Berkeley Yacc, supporting the generation
of pure elastiC parsers.
It is derived from Berkeley Yacc 1.8 (+ Cygnus.28) (01/20/91) and from
byacc/java 1.1 (from Bob Jamison)

Berkeley Yacc is an LALR(1) parser generator.  Berkeley Yacc has been made
as compatible as possible with AT&T Yacc.  Berkeley Yacc can accept any input
specification that conforms to the AT&T Yacc documentation.  Specifications
that take advantage of undocumented features of AT&T Yacc will probably be
rejected.

USAGE
-----

This version of byacc has been modified to use autoconf & automake.
To compile it, simply issue the commands:

  % configure
  % make
  % make install

This operation will compile the binary `byacc-ec'.
byacc-ec supports the same options of the original byacc 1.8, plus a
set of -E[option] options to produce elastiC code.
To get command-line usage information, issue the command:

  % byacc-ec -h

See also the example under the `sample-elastic' subdirectory.
To build the example:

  % cd sample-elastic
  % make

and to run it:

  % ec cal_driver.ecc
