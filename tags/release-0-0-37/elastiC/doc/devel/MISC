I have some doubts about the correctness of EcParameterCountErrorMethod() and
EcParameterCountErrorClassMethod(), since the first argument is used either as
the target of the offending method and either as the starting point in the class 
search process. When the parameter count mismatch appens for a call to a method
in a upper class and when the lower class has, say, the right number of args,
the method found would be that of the lower class.
