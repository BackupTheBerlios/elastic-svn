Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.37:

* win32 Visual C++ 6 support (VC 7 in progress)

* Alpha compatibility.
  (elastiC should be 64-bit clean now).

* Added `basic.apply' and and `basic.arity'

  The former takes two arguments: a callable object and a sequence of
  arguments and returns the result of the application of the callable
  to the arguments.
  For example:

      function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
      local v = basic.apply( add, #[1, 3] );

  will set v to 4.
  The latter will receive a callable object as a number and will
  return an array of two elements: the first is the number of
  minimum required arguments by the callable, the second if a
  boolean indicating if the callable takes a variable number of
  arguments. The API presently doesn't allow to know the number of
  parameters of primitive functions, so basic.arity works only for
  bytecode objects at the moment.

* Added `basic.printnl' (like basic.print but prints a final newline).

* Nasty bugs fixed (thanks to George McBay)

* Some steps toward Cygwin build-ability.

* Now uses automake 1.6, autoconf 2.53, libtool 1.4.2

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.36:

* `eval' functionality, provided by the new function
  `basic.compile()'. It compiles elastiC source code contained in a
  string returning a bytecode object. This bytecode object can be
  executed at any time by invoking it as a normal function.

     private source = "basic.print(\"value: \", val, \"\\n\");\n";

     public val = "Hello World!";
     private compiled = basic.compile( source );

     compiled();

* "import ..." and "from ... import ..." are now ordinary
  statements. This allows to import a package from everywhere (not
  only at the beginning of the current package, as before). This
  feature was needed also to implement the `eval' functionality.

* The compiler is now totally re-entrant. A big step towards totaly
  re-entrancy, since the compiler is the most big and complex
  subsystem.

* Fixed some things related to the regular expression module. Added
  `re.info()', `re.match_re()', `re.match_subject()'. An
  object-oriented wrapper to regexps is under way.

* Added `string.range()'

* Bug fixes.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.35:

* Fixed compilation problems.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.34:

* Now compiles with newer versions of gcc (2.96 and 3.x). And the code
  should be totally ANSI C compatible.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.33:

* Added '%' syntax to create strings with printf-like specifiers:

    "%d %s %-10s %.2f" % #[6, 1.2, "hey", 12.1]

* Added default values for function and method parameters. Now it is
  possible to specify something like:

    private m = 8;

    private function f1(a, b, c = a * b + m)
    {
        return a + b + c;
    }

  (the default values are evaluated at function call time inside the
   function scope).

* misc/elastic.st: initial version of an enscript stats
  filter. Put this file in your $HOME/.enscript directory and you
  can pretty-print elastiC code with the command:

    enscript -o OUTPUT.html -W html -Eelastic --color FILENAME.ec

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.32:

* Improved regression testing.

* Improved error messages for uncaught exceptions (package name,
  filename and line number are printed).

* Fixed suffix (`.ec' and `.ecc') configurability.

* Added basic.printf().

* Better error messages in ec_*printf() family of functions.

* Added named conversion specifiers (ala Python) to printf() & co: as
  in %(name)s, %12(name)s, %(name)12s, %4.1(name)f, %(name)4.1f, ...
  The named argument is fetched from a sequence, which must be
  specified as the next argument to the *printf() function and which
  must contain an entry with a symbol or a string equal to the used
  named:

     basic.sprintf("%d %(city)s %(age)d %(score)g\n",
                   1, %[#city,   "Rome",
                        #age,    21,
                        "score", 3.2]);

* Fixed a bug in ecdump that prevented its compilation on some
  architectures.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.31:

* Implemented sequence assignment to multiple lvalues:

     [lvalue1, ..., lvalueN] = expression

  where `expression' produces a sequence of length >= N

* Changed syntax of multiple simultaneous assignment: now uses
  brackets ([...] = [...]) instead of parenthesis to avoid a
  reduce/reduce conflict in the grammar.

* Added debug data to bytecode objects. Removed SetLineOP bytecode:
  now line information is stored in debug info.
  This has the great benefit of allowing to keep line number
  information in optimized versions of elastiC without any performance
  degradation (so regression tests won't fail when compiling without
  optimizations).

* Improved hashing for floating point values.

* Updated libltdl to version 1.2

* Bug fixes.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.30:

* Multiple simultaneous assignment. In a nutshell:

    (a, b, c, d) = (1.5, a - 1, b + 1, "Hi there");

  (Note that syntactically it is a statement, not an expression).

* More omogeneous printing support (ec_*printf*() family of
  functions).

* New API functions EcSymbolExists().

* Portability improvements.

* Bug fixes.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.29:

* Upgraded to PCRE 3.5 (which includes preliminary UTF-8 support).
  This should enable Unicode regular expressions.

* Some cleanups.

* Still some speed improvements.

* Applied fixes suggested by Alexander Bokovoy.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.28:

* *Big* speed-up in elastiC function calls.

* Minor general speed improvements.

* Fixed basic.times().

* Now should compile on ANSI compilers.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.27:

* Fixed a bug: multiple calls to EcCompile() could fail due to
  improper (re)initialization.

* Fixed a bug: static members were not initialized in imported super
  classes. This was caused by the fact that class code were not
  executed for imported classes, since these classes were loaded two
  times (see doc/devel/TODO).

* Works on IBM S/390

* Fixed some minor things.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.26:

* Fixed some minor things.

* Fixed alignment problems on platforms like Sparc, MIPS, m68k, ...

* Added getenv, setenv, unsetenv compatibility functions.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.25:

* Fixed bug in static-only versions of elastiC.
  The -rdynamic flag has been added, so that symbols in the elastiC
  executables can be referenced from shared objects (like C
  packages).

* Adapted to automake-1.5

* A new elastiC library without the compiler is built
  (elasticrt). Also a new run-time only executable (capable of
  executing only pre-compiled packages) has been added: ecrt.
  This latter one, compiled without debugging, optimized and
  stripped is only 166 Kb in size (on x86).

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.24:

* Added API functions to manipulate elastiC hash tables: see
  EcHash...() functions declared in src/elastic.h

* Changed API names for C hash-tables and string-tables from
  EcHash... to ec_hash_... and from EcStrTable... to
  ec_strtable_...

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.23:

* Fixed support for nested C packages.
  Bear in mind that if you have a nested C package called, for
  example, 'planet.earth', then the initialization and cleanup
  functions shall need to be called respectively:
    ec_planet__earth_init()
    ec_planet__earth_cleanup()
  The compiled package shall be searched as "planet/earth.so" (if .so
  is the extension for shared objects on this platform).

* Changed versioning scheme. Now it uses libtool versioning
  strategy (with option -version-info).

* Added new quick reference manual: doc/quickref.*

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.22:

* added user data to primitive functions. User data is passed in
  when creating/registering a new primitive function, and then on
  each invocation the user data is passed to the C function.
  The user data can be an EcAny value or an elastiC object: in the
  latter case the object will be marked and/or garbage collected as
  needed (you specify if it is an object through a parameter).
  This feature turns out to be useful in FFI mechanisms.

* src/unix/os.c: CLOCKS_PER_SEC wasn't a good substitute for
  CLK_TCK. Fixed (but would need a more elegant/portable solution).

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.21:

* Added EcGetClassVariable() and EcSetClassVariable().

* Fixed implementation of copy for arrays.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.20:

* Now compiles under recent GNU libc (2.2.x)

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.19:

* Added `elastic.el' (see `misc' subdir), that adds an elastiC
  major mode with font-lock support to (x)emacs.

* Added JED files to add an elastiC mode (see `misc'
  subdirectory).

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.18:

* Added assign-ops, like **=, *=, /=, +=, ...
  Added also a suitable test source for regression testing
  (see regress/test_assign.ec).

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.17:

* Faster hash table expansion. Tables up to 10^9 entries are now
  supported.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.16:

* Command line tools are now quieter by default. Previous behavior
  is enabled by -v switch. (Version is on -V).

* Added a generic UnimplementedException exception.

* Improved tkconf

* Improved support for cross-compilation: added autoconf/automake
  Makefile macros + makemodule script + elastic-config options to
  build dynamically loadable modules.

* Fixed elastic.m4 macro file.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.15:

* Added tkconf, first attempt to a graphical front-end to 'configure'

* Improved support for cross-compilation.

* Fixed silly bugs preventing compilation on some platforms (RedHat/Alpha
  for example).

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.14:

* Started WIN32 basic support.
  All basic functionality is there, even dynamic C module loading
  (with DLLs).

  Compilation is done with Mingw32 compiler toolchain by Mumit Khan
  <khan@xraylith.wisc.edu>
	http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/
  but cross-compiling from linux (thanks to Allin Cottrell for the
  hints on setting up the environment; see enclosed mingw.sh script
  for more info).
  Native compilation from Cygwin + Mingw32 from Win32 should be
  possible, but presently untested.

  There is even embrional, unfinished support for Microsoft Visual C++
  6.0 compilers.

* Added C++ compiler compatibility support (extern "C" { ... }).

* Added EC_API macro in front of public API symbols (variables and
  functions).

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.13:

* Eliminated bad GC anomaly causing continuous collection on some
  circumstances. This behavior caused very poor performance for memory 
  intensive programs (gtk module generator now runs 943% faster !).

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.12:

* Added and interface for dynamic loading of C code and an implementation
  based on libltdl.

* Doesn't install anymore unneeded libraries.

* Other optimizations in interpreter.

* Switched to inlined integers. Performance in integer math is much
  better: integer loops are >30% faster. And we don't even allocate
  memory for integers ! Added also inlined symbols. Maybe I'll implement
  inlined chars in the future.

* Integrated libltdl (from libtool-1.3.4) to dynamically open
  modules. Should greatly improve portability.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.11:

* fixed TargetError exception creation.

* fixed to allow empty methods and functions.

* fixed truth testing for objects of classes without a '_true' method.

* fixed basic.*copy() (inadvertently these functions didn't work
  because of a typo).

* fixed a bug in floating point printing.

* started a document on elastiC internal architecture.

* added a section on OOP in elastiC documentation.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.10:

* fixed a bug in lexical scoping for C called bytecode. (Critical to
  proper working of gtk callbacks).

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.9:

* fixed string.split() behavior.

* fixed syntax to allow for all optional parameters in varargs.

* string.find() returns false when no match is found.

* Preallocated low memory exception object.

* Added MathError and IOError exception classes.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.8:

* Minor bug fixes.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.7:

* Better object allocation.

* New 'array' module, with: length(), push(), pop(), shift(),
  unshift(), sub(), find().
  Apart from sub() it works on every ordered sequence.

* Strings expand on lvalue indexing.

* API updated to account for element removal.

* Minor bug fixes.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.6:

* Added labels and 'goto' (Sorry, I need it to implement lex &
  yacc in/for elastiC).

* Added 'doesUnderstand' method to basic.Object

* Added varargs also to keyword methods.

* Added basic.send() and basic.sendwith(). These two functions
  send a message to an object given the receiver object, the method
  symbol and the parameters for the method (the former as direct
  parameters, the latter as an array).

* Two (major) bug fixes related to OOP.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.5:

* Two bug fixes related to method calls, which caused hard to track
  problems.

* Corrected a bug in string.toupper() and string.tolower()

* Two major bug fixes related to compilation and package loading. API has
  changed slightly (see EcInit() and EcSetArgs()).

* Switched to 'configure' dependent basic type sizes.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.4:

* Added regular expression module 're' (based on pcre-2.08).
* Added string.ltrim, string.rtrim, string.trim, string.split,
  string.join, string.find
* Many bugs corrected
* Default path for modules (C and elastiC)
* New options for elastic-config for dynamically loadable C modules
* New elastic.m4 for automake, with AM_PATH_ELASTIC macro, useful when
  creating dynamically loadable modules in C.

Overview of Changes in elastiC 0.0.3:

* Switched to automake/libtool
* Changed version number scheme (see configure.in)
* Some documentation enhancements and bug fixes
* Some additions to string module
* Versioning in utilities & in API.
* Added elastic-config tool
